Frameworks: Materialize

Very easy to understand! In only a few hours I could get this made.
-loads of initial problems with grid wanting to show cards incorrectly; resolved with 'valign-wrapper' in the parent container of the cards
-only inline css was used for body, only to alter bg colour as I couldn't find correct method using framework:: "background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size: cover;"
