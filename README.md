# Frameworks: Materialize


## Verdict?

- Very easy to understand!
- Beautiful pre-made colour palette options
- Documentation is clean
- Responsive AF ;)

## Problems?

- loads of initial problems with grid wanting to show cards incorrectly; resolved with **'valign-wrapper' (Materialize class)** in the parent container of the cards

- only inline CSS was used for body, only to alter bg colour as I couldn't find correct method using framework:: "background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size: cover;" if anybody knows how to without inline style or ext. CSS please let me know! :)

- more exploration needed with *sidenav, hoverable, hide functions*
